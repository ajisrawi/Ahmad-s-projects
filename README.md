SDR Live Signal Lab Documentation Report 1. Task Overview Original Task: Create a comprehensive README.md file documenting the SDR Live Signal Lab application, including project overview, installation instructions, usage guide, architecture details, and development guidelines. Accomplishment: Successfully created a detailed README.md file that thoroughly documents all aspects of the SDR Live Signal Lab application. The documentation includes clear explanations of the application's features, setup process, usage instructions, and technical architecture. Additionally, several supporting visualizations were created to enhance understanding of the application's interface and functionality. 2. Final Output Description The following files were created as part of this task: Documentation File README.md - The main documentation file containing comprehensive information about the SDR Live Signal Lab application. Visualization Files (in the images folder) sdr_live_signal_lab_interface.png - A screenshot of the application's user interface showing the three main panels. modulation_types.png - Visual representations of different signal modulation types in both time and frequency domains. data_flow_diagram.png - A diagram illustrating how data flows between different components of the application. project_structure.png - A visual representation of the project's file and directory structure. 3. Key Features and Information The SDR Live Signal Lab application offers several notable features: Interactive Signal Generation: Create and manipulate AM, FM, BPSK, QPSK, and FSK modulated signals with adjustable parameters. Multi-view Signal Visualization: Observe signals simultaneously in time domain, frequency domain, and waterfall displays. AI-Powered Analysis: Leverage Google's Gemini API to provide educational explanations about signal characteristics. Real-time Processing: Experience immediate feedback when adjusting signal parameters. Educational Tool: Learn about different modulation techniques through interactive experimentation. The application is built using modern web technologies: Tailwind CSS for responsive design Plotly.js with WebGL for high-performance visualizations Web Audio API and DSP.js for signal processing Google Gemini API for intelligent signal analysis 4. Usage Instructions Accessing the Documentation Download the Files: All documentation files are available for download in the left sidebar, either individually or as a zipped folder. View the README: Open the README.md file using any Markdown viewer or text editor. GitHub and many code editors will automatically render the Markdown formatting. Access the Images: The images referenced in the README are located in the images folder. Ensure this folder is in the same directory as the README.md file for proper image rendering. Using the SDR Live Signal Lab Application According to the documentation, to use the application: Installation: Install Node.js (v16.0.0 or higher) Clone the repository and install dependencies Configure your Gemini API key in a .env file Start the development server with npm run dev Signal Generation: Select a modulation type (AM, FM, BPSK, QPSK, or FSK) Adjust parameters like carrier frequency, symbol rate, and signal-to-noise ratio Click "Generate Signal" to create and visualize the signal Signal Analysis: Observe the signal in the time domain, frequency domain, and waterfall displays Use the AI Analysis panel to get educational insights about the signal Experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the signal 5. Visualization Overview The documentation includes four key visualizations: Application Interface Screenshot This image shows the three-panel interface of the application: Left panel: Signal Generator with modulation options and parameters Top-right panel: Time Domain Visualization showing signal amplitude over time Bottom panels: Frequency Domain, Waterfall Display, and AI Analysis sections Modulation Types Visualization This comprehensive visualization shows five different modulation types (AM, FM, BPSK, QPSK, and FSK) in both time domain (left) and frequency domain (right). It helps users understand the distinctive characteristics of each modulation technique. Data Flow Diagram This diagram illustrates how data flows between the different components of the application: Signal Generator creates IQ data Signal Processor transforms the data Various visualizers render the data in different domains Signal Analyzer extracts features and parameters Gemini API provides educational insights Project Structure Diagram This visualization shows the file and directory structure of the project, helping developers understand how the application is organized and where to find specific components. 6. Conclusion The SDR Live Signal Lab documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and extending this web-based software-defined radio application.
